oR4gh5_NhOc,https://youtu.be/oR4gh5_NhOc,Scientists just figured out how to reverse aging using AI #shorts,"Scientists just figured out how to reverse aging using AI.

And this is a massive breakthrough‚Ä¶

We can now reprogram any human cell back to age 20.
Heart cells, brain cells, skin cells, all reset to their biological prime.
And here‚Äôs the wildest part‚Ä¶

The technology to do this, has already existed since 2012‚Ä¶.it won the Nobel Prize.
But the real breakthrough wasn‚Äôt possible until this year, when they supercharged it with AI.
It‚Äôs a wild story‚Ä¶
So in 2006, scientists discovered Yamanaka factors.
They‚Äôre proteins that can basically convert any normal cell into a universal stem cell.
Now this was a huge deal, because these stem cells are basically like magic healers. 
If you have torn muscle tissue, you could inject these stem cells into the area and they will turn into the youthful muscle cells you need.
So Yamanaka factors were this insane breakthrough‚Ä¶
Because they allowed any human to turn any cell you already have into these magic healers.
But‚Ä¶there was one big problem‚Ä¶
It turns out, the original Yamanaka factors weren‚Äôt very good at this stem cell conversion.
They could do it, but they just weren‚Äôt very reliable.
Enter OpenAI.
And this is where things get crazy.
OpenAI designed a special AI model built specifically to create new proteins‚Ä¶
Think of it like ChatGPT but for protein engineering.
So they took all the Yamanaka research and asked this new AI to go ham on improving it.
And get this‚Ä¶
Their version was 50x more effective than the original.
They tested it on 50 year old cells and it successfully started repairing 30% of their cells in just 7 days.
This is just science fiction‚Ä¶it actually happened.
And it sounds crazy, but in a few years, humans will be able to take a shot that will literally reverse the age of their cells.

XnT4BXjN35I,https://youtu.be/XnT4BXjN35I,This is the future of AI powered stores #shorts,"This is the future of AI powered stores‚Ä¶

What you‚Äôre seeing is a coffee shop.

But it‚Äôs not just any shop.

Because this coffee shop has AI software running 24/7 in all of their cameras.

You see those green boxes‚Ä¶

Each one of those is a customer.

And the AI is monitoring how long each person has been sitting in the cafe.

But here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs also monitoring the workers.

You can see it‚Äôs tracking their movement with those squiggly lines and their productivity, like how many drinks each person has served per hour.

The software is called Neurospot.

And it uses AI and machine learning to live track and analyze humans in physical stores.

Now of course‚Ä¶as a customer, my immediate reaction is shock and fear.

It feels super weird to know you‚Äôre being tracked everywhere you go.

But as a business owner‚Ä¶having access to this level of real-time analytics could be super valuable.

For example‚Ä¶

If you ran a buffet, this software could immediately detect which areas were less popular so you could know how to rotate the menu.

Or if you ran a hardware store, you could study which aisles people linger the longest as a signal for confusion in signage and layouts.

There are endless applications for this type of data.

CCTVAI, it‚Äôd be a lot harder to steal stuff.

But the real reason this is so valuable‚Ä¶is because this footage will be used to train robots.

The best way for robots to learn is to watch humans complete the same task over and over.

And because of that‚Ä¶

g7Lmlk2ZjXI,https://youtu.be/g7Lmlk2ZjXI,There's a secret Japanese tech city hidden at the base of Mt. Fuji #shorts,"There is a secret Japanese tech city being built at the base of Mt. Fuji.

But it‚Äôs not just any city‚Ä¶

This city is a real-world test lab for cutting edge technology.

AI, robotics, smart homes, even flying cars.

All the latest tech in one giant town, populated by real people.

It‚Äôs called the Woven City.

It was built by Toyota, and the city just opened its doors to real residents last week.

The Woven city looks like it‚Äôs straight out of a sci-fi movie.

But the coolest part‚Ä¶is the road system.

Instead of one main type of transportation, the architect split the city into 3 different road types.

One for higher speed autonomous vehicles.

A second for personal mobility with ebikes and scooters.

And a third with linear parks and human-only walkways.

The three roadtypes are then interweaved into 3 by 3 grids throughout the city.

Woven together like fabric, to create the most efficient and natural flow.

But this is only part of what makes the transportation system so cool...

Because there‚Äôs a whole AI logistics network built underneath the ground.

Goods and supplies will move around the city automatically in underground tunnels with self-driving robots, delivered directly into each house through pressurized tubes.

All of the roads, tunnels, houses, and vehicles will be interconnected and fully tech enabled.

Think of it like having one giant living prototype.

XfHHeuqUzWQ,https://youtu.be/XfHHeuqUzWQ,We officially just entered the era of the worldbuilder #shorts,"This is one of the wildest AI demos you‚Äôll ever see.

What you‚Äôre seeing is called Vocal Worldbuilding.

This is where artists and creators can use words to describe a visual environment and have it come to life in real-time.

It‚Äôs pretty wild.

For example, in this demo, the creator is iteratively building a scene in Manhattan.

First he lays the city structures, and then adds graffiti and other objects, all one after another in rapid succession.

But the coolest part is when he says, ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs make this come alive‚Äù and the people and cars start moving inside the world he just created.

It‚Äôs kind of like GTA or Sims but being built and iterated in real-time.

We are about to enter an entirely new era of visual expression.

One where anyone can build worlds like this from scratch with just their voice.

Think Tony Stark talking to Jarvis, but to build entire digital environments that you can play and work inside of.

And this is being made possible by AI tools like Genie 3 from Google, Runway ML and Veo 3.

In my mind, AI world models are gonna change everything about the way fans interact with their favorite projects.

Musicians and artists will be able to invent a whole new category of spaces to consume their art.

Brands will be able to build immersive worlds for their biggest fans.

Imagine if your favorite clothing brand could build their version of a digital Disney World from scratch in just a few days?

It‚Äôs all coming and will be made possible by AI world models.

If you‚Äôre a creator, artist, entrepreneur or brand‚Ä¶strap in.

lP7jj4CRISo,https://youtu.be/lP7jj4CRISo,This new AI video model can think creatively on its own #shorts,"This is a brand new AI video model that can think creatively on its own.

It doesn‚Äôt just make videos from prompts, it can actually reason through creative decisions before it generates anything.

This is Ray3 from Luma AI.

And I‚Äôm telling you, this is the new state of the art for AI video.

Here‚Äôs why the reasoning is so impressive.

Let‚Äôs say you have a starting image of a woman, and you prompt ‚Äúhave the woman look down, show two vintage phones, and then have her pick up the blue one.‚Äù

Now most video models would try to generate this scene.

And maybe you get it perfect on the first try, but usually not.

Typically you‚Äôre stuck generating 20 different videos over half an hour, hoping to get lucky with the slot machine pull.

But Ray3 works completely differently.

Ray3 also generates the first video, but then it can think back to the original context and use creative logic and reasoning to grade the output.

It can detect when the clip doesn‚Äôt make sense creatively or cinematically, figure out what to fix, and will regenerate it again on its own.

It runs this logic loop over and over until it‚Äôs happy with a shot that matches your original intention.

And does that all automatically for you, which is pretty crazy.

If you make videos, this is kinda like you have an editor or director embedded into the AI by default.

The bar for AI video, has just been raised again.",UCWs1D4c4vYv8PgkIiN1gLXQ,Kallaway,2025-09-26T13:30:52Z,"Ray3, LumaAI, AIVideo, AIEditor, AIDirector, CreativeAI, VideoGeneration, VideoEditingAI, NextGenAI, ArtificialIntelligence, StateOfTheArt, AIVideoModel, AICreativity, FutureOfVideo, CinematicAI, ContentCreationAI, VideoTech, AIReasoning, AIInnovation, FilmmakingTools, CreatorTools, VideoEditing, CreativeTools, DigitalCreation, AIFuture, TechInnovation, VideoProduction, VideoAI, StorytellingAI, NewAITech, AIContent, CreativeLogic, SmartAI, FilmmakingInnovation, AICinema",22,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lP7jj4CRISo/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lP7jj4CRISo/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lP7jj4CRISo/hqdefault.jpg,People & Blogs,Entertainment,en,en,PT1M14S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,6685,425,0,4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment,,
4shKz-CsqDw,https://youtu.be/4shKz-CsqDw,OpenAI just launched their own social platform #shorts,"OpenAI just launched their own social platform.

It‚Äôs called Sora 2.

And this is officially the moment where the AI race got interesting.

In the new app, you can train an AI avatar of yourself, and then use it to make AI generated videos.

So think of it like a brand new social feed, but with only AI-generated content.

Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking...

We do not need another social feed.
¬†
And we definitely don‚Äôt need another one with AI slop content.

And I agree, but there are some pretty interesting features here.

For one, the memeability in this app is gonna be insane.

You‚Äôre gonna be able to collab with celebrities that open up their likeness to the public.

So if Drake lets me, I can put him and I in our own version of Oceans 11, and the quality of the videos is actually pretty insane.

You‚Äôre gonna see actors doing skits with athletes, celebrities cross posting with musicians, it‚Äôs gonna be wild to see how this evolves.

I predict this AI social app will become a brand new surface for creativity, and give birth to an entire new genre of creators.

But the reason this launch is so interesting, actually has nothing to do with the features in the app.

The reason it‚Äôs so interesting is because this launch represents a trillion dollar 4D chess game that‚Äôs playing out in real-time.

Every tech company is trying to build a full stack strategy for AI.

They want to own the consumer hardware layer, the AI models, the applications, and most importantly, the social distribution.

It‚Äôs not enough to just have an AI model like ChatGPT, you also need to control the consumer hardware it‚Äôs used on, and have a social asset to drive new users to it.

So what you‚Äôre really witnessing with the launch of this app, is a shot across the bow by OpenAI as they jostle for tech positioning.

OpenAI already has the world‚Äôs best AI models and applications, but they have no consumer hardware device or social distribution.

Well, they just acquired Jony Ive to build the hardware, and Sora 2 is their distribution.

What you‚Äôre watching is an all out business war at a scale we‚Äôve never seen.¬†

The service remains free while awaiting regulatory approval for paid rides.

OpenAI and Anthropic lead, but no clear winners have emerged in most categories as startups experiment with multiple tools.

Vibe coding platforms like Replit rank highly, with enterprise features driving significantly more revenue than consumer-focused competitors. 

Creative tools represent the largest category, with consumer apps like Midjourney and Canva being adopted in workplace settings. 

Notably, 70 percent of these enterprise tools originated as consumer products, moving to company-wide deployment in under two years‚Äîa dramatic acceleration from traditional enterprise software adoption cycles.

afbZOtWyrVI,https://youtu.be/afbZOtWyrVI,3 VS Code Extensions Every Developer Needs! #frontend #frontenddevelopment #webdevelopment,"Front-end development is the practice of crafting the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application, focusing on how users interact with and experience the digital product. It involves writing code that runs in the browser, translating design concepts into functional, responsive, and accessible interfaces. At the heart of front-end development lies HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, each playing a crucial role in shaping the web. HTML provides the structural foundation, defining the content and layout of a webpage, while CSS brings that structure to life with style, color, typography, and layout. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling dynamic behavior and enhancing user experience. Together, these technologies form the backbone of the modern web, allowing developers to create everything from simple static pages to complex, interactive web applications.

CSS, in particular, is a powerful tool that goes beyond mere styling‚Äîit is a medium for creativity and artistic expression. With CSS, developers can manipulate the appearance of HTML elements, creating visually stunning designs that captivate users. The language allows for precise control over layout, enabling the creation of complex grid systems, flexible responsive designs, and intricate animations. CSS transforms the mundane into the extraordinary, turning basic shapes and text into works of art. By leveraging properties like gradients, shadows, transforms, and transitions, developers can craft unique visual experiences that push the boundaries of what is possible on the web. The introduction of CSS Grid and Flexbox has further revolutionized layout design, providing developers with the tools to create sophisticated, responsive designs with ease.",UCimf5cuzTOAMJJZ3n9RZ6kg,Alaa Alaff,2025-07-27T16:43:50Z,"front end development, css art, web design, html5, css tricks, web development, coding art, creative coding, web art, html css, css animation, web design tips, front end coding, web creativity, css design, html css art, web dev tutorial, css magic, web art design, coding for beginners, html, css, css developer, css tips, css code, css trick, frontend, front end",28,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/afbZOtWyrVI/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/afbZOtWyrVI/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/afbZOtWyrVI/hqdefault.jpg,Science & Technology,Technology,en,en,PT23S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,454196,10612,0,45,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology,,

If you‚Äôre still paying for AI API keys, you‚Äôre throwing money away. There are sites that let you grab free keys for big models like Gemini, DeepSeek, and Qwen. No tricks. Just straight access.

Take Google AI Studio. You sign up, grab a free key, and suddenly you‚Äôve got Gemini 2.5 ready to go. It‚Äôs like walking into a buffet and realizing the best dish is free. I‚Äôve used it to test small apps, and it never cost a dime.

Then there‚Äôs OpenRouter. This one feels like a huge library where every shelf has a different model. Over 50 of them.

Free keys for DeepSeek R1, Kimi, Qwen 3, and more. It‚Äôs fast and super easy to get started. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the one I point friends to when they‚Äôre new to AI.

And last, Groq. Think of it like the corner store with quick grab-and-go options. You won‚Äôt get the biggest models here, but you will find solid ones like Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral. Perfect for lightweight tasks that still need speed.

The point? Stop paying when you don‚Äôt have to. These three cover almost everything you‚Äôd ever need.

AI overviews reduce clicks by 34.5%.

Triggered 99% by informational keywords.

Informational keywords are how, what, why, when, where.

Instead, target keywords like make, track, create, generate. Action keywords.

Think about every possible use case that your brand or service satisfies.

Anything that you can do for customers.

This is called action mapping.

Here's an example. This software lists all the different things that it can do. Each one of these is a page targeting a keyword.

Regardless of whether you're a product or a service, make pages like this, targeting these keywords where people know what they want, but they don't know the brand that will give them what they want.

AI takes clicks away from informational keywords, but redirects searchers to purchase intent keywords.

Ytjkg2SRoos,https://youtu.be/Ytjkg2SRoos,Cluely is an undetectable Invisible AI Assistant that answers everything for you,"My Main Channel  ‚Å®@nicksaraev 
 
My Skool community: https://www.skool.com/makerschool/about?ref=0a3be5900d60497cb3542cca1ed3fdcb

Everyone‚Äôs talking about this new AI. It‚Äôs called Cluely. People describe it like having superpowers in your pocket.

Here‚Äôs how it works. It watches everything on your screen. It listens to the conversation you‚Äôre in. And then‚Äîwhen you feel stuck‚Äîyou just hit a key. Boom. The answer shows up. Only you can see it.

Picture this. You‚Äôre in a job interview. The manager asks you a tough question. Normally, your mind would go blank. But with Cluely, the perfect reply pops up instantly. You look calm. Confident. Sharp.

Same thing on a sales call. The client throws an objection at you. Instead of fumbling, you deliver a smooth, clever response. They nod. They trust you. All because Cluely whispered the right words in real time.

What makes it wild? Nobody knows you‚Äôre using it. It‚Äôs invisible.

Not your boss. Not the interviewer. Not your teacher.

Some people swear it feels like a secret weapon. Like having a coach in your ear. Or a cheat sheet you‚Äôre not supposed to have.

Because think about it. With Cluely, you can walk into situations that would normally make your palms sweat. And suddenly, you‚Äôre unstoppable:

1. Exams where you don‚Äôt crack under pressure
2. Calls where you sound like the smartest person in the room
3. Meetings where every answer lands perfectly

But here‚Äôs the catch. People are divided. Some say it‚Äôs brilliant. Others call it cheating. The question hangs in the air: if AI feeds you answers, are you really the one winning?

I think about it like wearing earbuds before giving a speech. If someone backstage is telling you what to say, you‚Äôll sound incredible. But is it really your voice? That‚Äôs the debate swirling around Cluely‚Äîand why everyone can‚Äôt stop talking about it.

RJjQLbzPQQ0,https://youtu.be/RJjQLbzPQQ0,AI Browsers are the next big trend and GenSpark and Dia Browsers are first of their kind,"AI is making browsers way smarter. Not just in small ways. In big ways. And it‚Äôs not something far off. It‚Äôs happening right now.

Take Genspark. This browser connects to more than 700 apps. That‚Äôs like having a helper who can use almost every tool you need. Want to turn a YouTube video into a slideshow? Genspark can do that. Want to find the best price for something? It checks lots of sites at once. The browser does the hard work for you. Searching, comparing, even blocking annoying ads. It‚Äôs the kind of thing that makes you realize how much time you‚Äôve been wasting before.

Then there‚Äôs Dia. This one lets you chat with your tabs. You can ask it to summarize a long article. Or write an email for you. It helps you shop, learn, and plan. The best part? It‚Äôs easy. You don‚Äôt need to be a tech expert. Just type what you want, and Dia does the rest.

I tried Dia last week. I had a bunch of tabs open for a project. I asked it to compare two laptops. In seconds, it gave me a simple summary. No need to read everything myself. It saved me a lot of time.

Here‚Äôs what these browsers can do for you:

1. They automate tasks, so you don‚Äôt have to do them.
2. They‚Äôre simple to use, even if you‚Äôre not a tech person.
3. They work fast, finding answers quicker than you can.

In the end, these browsers make the internet easier and more helpful. They help you do more, with less effort. Try them out. You might find they change how you use the web every day. You might even wonder how you ever got by without them.

pqDxElXLZE4,https://youtu.be/pqDxElXLZE4,"Google Just dropped Opal AI, their no-code AI Automation builder","Google just dropped something new. It‚Äôs called Opal. A no-code platform where you can build AI apps without writing a single line of code. And the wild part? It‚Äôs free.

Think of it like mixing n8n‚Äôs automation with Lovable‚Äôs simplicity. But with a twist. You don‚Äôt drag things around and wire them together. You just‚Ä¶tell it what you want in plain English.

I tried it out. I asked Opal to build me an AI ad generator. In seconds, it pulled everything together. First, it asked me about my product. Then a few follow-up questions. Finally, it used Veo 3 to write a polished ad. I didn‚Äôt touch a single workflow. It just worked.

The experience feels more like chatting with a person than using software. You describe what‚Äôs in your head. And suddenly, you‚Äôve got an app‚Äîwith a clean, interactive front-end you can actually use.

And here‚Äôs the kicker:

1. You can jump in and edit the workflow anytime
2. You can tweak how the app looks and feels
3. You can share it with one click

It‚Äôs the kind of tool that makes building apps feel like writing a note. Quick. Effortless. Almost too easy.

Picture this: instead of a long weekend building a lead form with automations hooked up to a database‚Ä¶you just describe it. ‚ÄúI want a lead capture tool that asks for email, sends a welcome note, and logs responses into a sheet.‚Äù Done.

When I first saw it in action, it reminded me of the early days of Google Docs. Simple. Free. But powerful enough that teams started adopting it everywhere.

The difference? This time it‚Äôs not just about documents. It‚Äôs about apps you can run, edit, and share without touching code.

Makes you wonder‚Äîhow many businesses will now skip hiring developers for small internal tools and just use Opal instead?

Feeling stuck or overwhelmed on your YouTube journey? You're not alone. The biggest challenge for creators today isn't a lack of information‚Äîit's information overload. Consuming endless tutorials without taking action is the #1 reason small YouTubers stay small.

Sean sits down with Pat Flynn, a 7-figure entrepreneur who has built multiple YouTube channels to over 1 million subscribers (Deep Pocket Monster & Short Pocket Monster). Pat breaks down his ""Lean Learning"" framework, designed to help you achieve more by learning less.

You'll discover:

-The #1 mistake that kills channel growth (and how to avoid it).

-The 25-Point Creator Skill Tree for modern YouTubers.

-Why storytelling is the most important skill you can learn (and how to master it).

-Pat's 60-day strategy for starting with Shorts vs. Long Form content.

-How to finally beat perfectionism with the ""Cringe Before You Binge"" mindset.

If you're ready to stop the endless cycle of consumption and start seeing real growth, this video is your blueprint.

Our mission here at Think Media is to help purpose-driven entrepreneurs go full-time doing what they love and making an impact through the power of video.

O4Jq9Tw-xxQ,https://youtu.be/O4Jq9Tw-xxQ,Rocket.New is a New AI Coder that builds full stack complete applications all on its own.,"Tired of paying for Bolt or V0? You don‚Äôt have to anymore. There‚Äôs a new tool in town‚ÄîRocket.new. Describe your idea in plain English. The AI does the rest. Frontend, backend, database, payments, user logins. All built for you. It feels like magic.

Here‚Äôs what makes Rocket.new different:

1. You‚Äôre not just getting a pretty app. Rocket builds the engine too. Fast.

2 Want payments? Handled. User accounts? Easy. Need a database? Done.

3. No more copying code from here to there. Rocket assembles it all.

I once tried making a simple bookings app. With old tools, it meant days piecing together random code. Rocket? Ten minutes. I just wrote, ‚ÄúLet users schedule meetings, see availability, pay online.‚Äù Boom. Working site.

Another cool part? Got a Figma design you love. Upload it. Rocket turns it into real, production code‚Äîinstantly. No more back-and-forth with developers. What you design is what you launch.

It‚Äôs kind of like giving your app idea a shortcut through developer school. Everything just works, right out of the box.

Want to build something new? Rocket.new lets you go from napkin sketch to running app. In minutes, not months. And you don‚Äôt pay for tools you barely use.

The good news? The old way isn‚Äôt coming back. It‚Äôs about building smarter, not harder.

zkBYhnsNAP0,https://youtu.be/zkBYhnsNAP0,"Google Just dropped Stitch AI, their new Free AI UI Designer","Google just dropped something new. It‚Äôs called Stitch. An AI that builds UI designs for you. And yes‚Äîit‚Äôs completely free.

Here‚Äôs how it works. You don‚Äôt need to be a designer. Just type what you want in plain English. Like ‚Äúa clean fitness tracking app.‚Äù Or ‚Äúa cool landing page for a travel blog.‚Äù Stitch turns that into a real design. Fast.

Not into typing? Upload a picture. Or a quick sketch. Even a messy wireframe works. The AI looks at it, fills in the gaps, and hands back a polished UI.

And it doesn‚Äôt just give you one option. It gives you more than ten. Different looks. Different layouts. So, you‚Äôre not stuck with just one style.
Editing? Easy. You can tweak the design by talking to it. Say things like:

1. ‚ÄúAdd more color.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúMake the buttons bigger.‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúSwitch to dark mode.‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. The design updates right away.

Now here‚Äôs the cool part. You can move your designs straight into Figma with one click. Or grab the front-end code if you‚Äôre ready to build. No messy exporting. No extra steps.

It‚Äôs like having a designer on call‚Äîwithout needing to hire one.

I tried it with a quick idea for a food delivery app. Honestly, my sketch looked like a kid drew it. Stitch cleaned it up, gave me multiple sleek versions, and suddenly I had something that looked real.

TDQyD25FScE,https://youtu.be/TDQyD25FScE,What would ChatGPT 6 look like? Prof Richard Susskind talks AI,"Six futures for AI. Are we ready?

When GPT-4 wrote something that mimicked his own published work, Professor Richard Susskind CBE KC (Hon) felt a shift. If AI can already write like this, what happens next?

In the full talk, he outlines six possible directions for AI, from modest improvements to complete transformation:

1. The Hype Hypothesis ‚Äì AI hits limits and fades
2. Generative AI+ ‚Äì tools improve but stay narrow
3. AGI ‚Äì machines match human intelligence
4. Superintelligence ‚Äì systems surpass us
5. The Singularity ‚Äì humans and machines merge
6. AI Evolution ‚Äì intelligent systems replace us

Which future are we heading toward?

Join me as I chat with James (The Boring Marketer), where he shares how he partnered with a friend to create a mobile diesel repair service website using Claude Code, achieving top Google rankings almost immediately. He demonstrates a step-by-step process for identifying keywords, conducting SEO audits, and optimizing content for local search. The case study illustrates how AI tools can help entrepreneurs dominate local service markets with minimal technical knowledge.

Key Points:
‚Ä¢ James built a website for a local diesel truck repair business using Claude Code in just 4 hours and generated thousands in revenue within 24 hours
‚Ä¢ Local service businesses represent a significant opportunity because competition is often unsophisticated with outdated websites
‚Ä¢ Basic SEO optimization using AI tools can quickly outrank established local competitors
‚Ä¢ The process combines AI-assisted keyword research, technical SEO fixes, and content creation focused on local relevance

1) The Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity Nobody's Talking About

While everyone's building AI agents and SaaS tools, they're IGNORING boring local businesses in their backyard!

James partnered with a friend to create a mobile diesel repair service for trucks and built the entire online presence using Claude Code.

The result? Phone BLOWING UP with calls within 24 hours of launch! 

2) The Barbell Strategy for AI Disruption

James shared a fascinating insight:

""What if we have AGI takeoff by 2030 and digital services get super disrupted?""

His solution: Build a portfolio with digital businesses on one side and ""boring"" local businesses on the other.

Local service businesses = HIGH DEFENSIBILITY against AI disruption!

3) The Claude Code Website Hack

James built an ENTIRE professional website with 50+ optimized pages in just 4 HOURS using Claude Code!

The site includes:
‚Ä¢ Service pages
‚Ä¢ Location-specific content
‚Ä¢ Technical SEO optimization
‚Ä¢ Mobile responsiveness

4) The Simple SEO Process That Actually Works

Forget complicated SEO tools and analysis paralysis! Here's James' vibe marketing approach:

1. Ask AI for 25-50 relevant keywords
2. Map keywords to user intent (emergency, service, problem, local)
3. Create dedicated pages for each keyword
4. Run an SEO audit with Claude
5. Fix technical issues automatically

5) The ""Ultra Think"" Command for Dominating Local Search

James used this POWERFUL prompt with Claude:

""Go through this website in extreme detail. Ultra think about this. Find all technical and on-page SEO issues so I can dominate the local market.""

Claude found and fixed:
‚Ä¢ Missing technical files
‚Ä¢ Slow loading speeds
‚Ä¢ Schema markup issues
‚Ä¢ Internal linking opportunities

All automatically! 

6) The Sub-Agent Hack for Parallel Optimization

While working on one part of the site, James had Claude launch THREE separate agents to work simultaneously on:

‚Ä¢ Finding missing alt text
‚Ä¢ Analyzing competitors
‚Ä¢ Identifying content opportunities

7) The Google PageSpeed Insights Trick

Want to instantly improve your rankings?

1. Run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights (free tool!)
2. Copy any errors directly into Claude Code
3. Let Claude fix them automatically

8) The Design Secret: Figma + Anima + Claude

How did James make his site look professional and NOT AI-generated?

1. Get a designer to create in Figma first
2. Use Anima plugin to convert Figma to React components
3. Let Claude assemble the components into a website

Result: A site that looks custom-designed but built with AI speed!

9) The Simple Dev Environment Setup

For non-technical folks:
‚Ä¢ Install Claude Desktop ($20/month)
‚Ä¢ Set up GitHub for version control
‚Ä¢ Connect to Vercel for hosting

You‚Äôll see how to run an audit that uncovers hidden automation wins, sets the roadmap, and positions you to lead the long-term AI strategy ‚Äî not just build random tools. And the side effect is: these can set you up to land development deals, too. If you want to be seen as a trusted AI advisor (not just another implementer), this video gives you the roadmap.

But in 2025, that‚Äôs not how search works anymore. In this video, I break down how Google‚Äôs AI is quietly rewriting the rules, and how you can train it to cite your brand as the trusted source. This isn‚Äôt about chasing keywords. It‚Äôs about showing up in AI Overviews, owning high-intent moments, and building authority while your competitors chase outdated SEO tactics.

I‚Äôll show you:

- How Google‚Äôs AI decides who gets visibility ‚Äî even if you rank #1
- Where AI Overviews actually show up (and where they don‚Äôt)
- Why the real battle is for citations, not clicks
- How to reverse-engineer the content AI already trusts
- The one move that turns search into a brand-building engine

bwctFbS010w,https://youtu.be/bwctFbS010w,"There‚Äôs a new free tool that lets you build apps and websites in minutes, called DeepSite V2","You don‚Äôt need to pay for Bolt, Lovable, or even Cursor anymore. There‚Äôs a new free tool that lets you build apps and websites in minutes.

It‚Äôs called DeepSite V2 and it runs on the DeepSeek reasoning model. You can find it on Hugging Face. The best part? It‚Äôs amazing at UI design.

I tried it last week. I just typed what I wanted, and the site appeared in seconds. It felt like magic, but it‚Äôs just good AI.

DeepSeek-R1 is now available too. You can edit any part of your site. Want to change a button or a headline? Just click on it.

You can even redesign any website you find online. Just paste the link, and DeepSite V2 does the rest. It‚Äôs that simple.

Here‚Äôs what I love about it:
100% open source ‚Äì UI and models are free to use and change.
No limits ‚Äì Build as much as you want, no hidden fees.
Easy edits ‚Äì Click anything to change it, no coding needed.

This tool is for anyone who wants to make a website fast. Think of it like a super-easy Lego set for the web. You just snap the pieces together.

A friend of mine used it to build a portfolio. She said it took her less time than making a sandwich.

If you want to try it, just comment ‚ÄúDeepSite‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeepSeek.‚Äù I‚Äôll send you the link. No need to pay for fancy tools when this one does the job for free.

It‚Äôs like having a web designer in your pocket. And the best part? You don‚Äôt even need to know how to code.

Give it a shot. You might be surprised how quickly you can get a site up and running. Sometimes, the best tools are the ones you don‚Äôt have to pay for.

Early adopters have already used Stitch for a wide range of projects‚Äîfrom a pop art event app to a homepage for an electric motorcycle brand, and even a food delivery service for dogs. The tool allows users to rapidly iterate through design changes, switch themes, generate multiple interface pages, and translate entire apps. All generated layouts can be exported to Figma and then to code once finalized.

Stitch also supports sketch-based input, turning hand-drawn designs into editable UI layouts. While some users report strong results, others note that the tool still has rough edges.

Join me, Nik ( https://x.com/CoFoundersNik ), as I interview Minh Nguyen ( https://x.com/minhnxn ). In this episode, we dive deep into the exciting world of AI and how it's revolutionizing the way we build businesses and gather information online.

Minh, coming straight from the heart of tech in the Bay Area, shares his practical experiences using various Large Language Models like Claude, ChatGPT, and the often-overlooked Gemini for tasks ranging from coding to deep research. We explore his journey building Cash On (https://t.co/h6riUWybER), a powerful Chrome extension for real estate investors, and uncover the surprising potential of simple browser tools.

Get ready to learn about AI-powered web scraping, the rise of directory websites and programmatic SEO, and how no-code platforms like Lovable and Bolt are empowering non-technical founders to bring their app ideas to life.


Questions This Episode Answers:
What AI tools (like LLMs) do you use and for what specific purposes?
Why do you think people are ""sleeping on"" Gemini?
How can AI be utilized for web scraping and data acquisition?
What are some good types of app ideas to start with when using no-code or low-code tools?
How can I leverage my existing content (like podcast episodes) using AI?
Enjoy the conversation!

Midjourney just released Version 7, and it‚Äôs packed with game-changing tools: a full AI-powered image editor, smart layer editing, and powerful features like Retexture, Omni Reference, and even Conversation Mode that feels like ChatGPT.

Whether you're a total beginner or a Midjourney pro, this tutorial will give you everything you need to get started with the new editor and see how far the platform has come.

This Stable Diffusion workflow can be combined with my character model sheet workflow for consistency. It's great for movie pre-visualization, concept art, or graphic novel panels, since it can handle multiple characters through automatic regional prompting. To demonstrate its full potential, I'll use it with Dream Machine, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, ElevenLabs, Udio, and DaVinci Resolve to create a full AI short film about the endless fight between knights and gnomes.

China vs Japan: Why Japan is Preparing for War?
Farewell to Pacifism: Japan is rearming

China and Japan has been driven home by a number of incidents between the two countries. For example, in January 2013 a Chinese navy vessel directed a fire-control radar at a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer. A little over a year later, in May and June 2014, two Chinese military fighter aircraft flew unusually close to Japanese military aircraft. These incidents could have led to a much wider conflagration, particularly in the absence of a crisis communications mechanism.",UCfWNZIJkm268rLO_yeRlcww,Business Basics,2024-05-08T17:50:58Z,"Investing, Investments, Finance, Wall Street, ETF, Stock Market, Warren Buffett, Economy, Long Term, Bonds, Bitcoin, Portfolio, big tech hearing, tech ceo hearing, amazon, google, facebook, jeff bezos, mark zuckerberg, antitrust, antitrust hearing, tech hearing today, antitrust hearing today, reuters, live video, tech hearing live, Sundar Pichai, reuters news, news, live news, apple, tim cook, big tech, trump, biden",27,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MoI6xgAQTo/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MoI6xgAQTo/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MoI6xgAQTo/hqdefault.jpg,Education,"Military, Politics, Society",en,en-US,PT2H43M48S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,2359850,45381,0,3185,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",,
